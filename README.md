# 👋 About Me  

Hey there! I’m **Octus**, a curious coder who loves building, automating, and learning along the way. While I have a passion for cybersecurity and pentesting, I’m always exploring new areas and experimenting with different projects.  

I enjoy working on:  
- 🔓 **Pentesting tools** for ethical hacking and security testing
- 🌐 **Browser automation and scripting** (yes, I love working with `requests`)  
- 🛠️ Private projects to push my coding skills further
