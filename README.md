about_me: |
  Hey there! I’m **Octus**, a curious coder who loves building, automating, and learning along the way. 
  While I have a passion for cybersecurity and pentesting, I’m always exploring new areas and experimenting with different projects.

  I enjoy working on:
    - 🔓 **Pentesting tools** for ethical hacking and security testing
    - 🌐 **Browser automation and scripting** (yes, I love working with `requests`)
    - 🛠️ Private projects to push my coding skills further

currently_up_to:
  - Building tools to make life easier (and occasionally more fun)
  - Exploring automation frameworks and testing cool ideas
  - Diving deeper into Python’s endless possibilities

learning_goals:
  - Becoming a pro at **Python** scripting
  - Gaining more expertise in **cybersecurity** and **automation**
  - Improving how I approach **problem-solving** with creative tools

fun_facts:
  - I love breaking things just to understand how they work (and then fixing them... maybe).
  - I use `requests` so much, it’s practically my sidekick.
  - I’m constantly experimenting, even if it means keeping some projects private.
