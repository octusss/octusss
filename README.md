# 👋 About Me  

Hey there! I’m **Octus**, a curious coder who loves building, automating, and learning along the way. While I have a passion for cybersecurity and pentesting, I’m always exploring new areas and experimenting with different projects.

I enjoy working on:  
- 🔓 **Pentesting tools** for ethical hacking and security testing
- 🌐 **Browser automation and scripting** (yes, I love working with `requests`)  
- 🛠️ Private projects to push my coding skills further  

---

## 🛠️ What I’m Currently Up To  
- Building tools to make life easier (and occasionally more fun)  
- Exploring automation frameworks and testing cool ideas  
- Diving deeper into Python’s endless possibilities  

---

## 🌱 Learning Goals  
- Becoming a pro at **Python** scripting  
- Gaining more expertise in **cybersecurity** and **automation**  
- Improving how I approach **problem-solving** with creative tools  

---

## 👨‍💻 Fun Facts  
- I love breaking things just to understand how they work (and then fixing them... maybe).  
- I use `requests` so much, it’s practically my sidekick.  
- I’m constantly experimenting, even if it means keeping some projects private.
